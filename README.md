🎬 IMDB Movies Database Analysis using SQL

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing comprehensive data analysis on an IMDB Movies dataset using SQL. The objective is to extract meaningful insights related to movie performance, audience preferences, genre trends, and contributor impact (directors and actors). The project simulates real-world business queries that a Data Analyst would solve in the entertainment or media domain.

🎯 Problem Statement

The film industry generates large volumes of data, but extracting actionable insights requires efficient querying and analytical thinking.
This project aims to answer key analytical questions such as:

Which movies are top-rated and most popular?

Which genres perform best in terms of ratings and volume?

Who are the most successful directors and actors?

How do budget, revenue, and ratings relate to movie success?

What trends exist across different release years?

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset is sourced from IMDB Movies data and contains structured information about films.

Key Attributes:

Movie title

Release year

Genre

Duration

IMDB rating

Number of votes

Director name

Actor names

Budget and revenue

The dataset is stored in relational format, making it suitable for SQL-based analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Database: MySQL

Language: SQL

Environment: MySQL Workbench

Dataset: IMDB Movies Dataset

🔍 SQL Concepts & Techniques Used

This project demonstrates practical usage of both basic and advanced SQL concepts:

Data filtering using WHERE

Sorting using ORDER BY

Aggregations using COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX

Group-based analysis using GROUP BY and HAVING

Multi-table analysis using JOIN

Subqueries for nested logic

Conditional logic using CASE

Date and string functions

Query optimization and structured query design

📊 Analysis Performed

The following analyses were conducted using SQL queries:

Identification of top-rated movies based on IMDB ratings

Analysis of most-voted and most popular movies

Genre-wise movie count and average ratings

Year-wise movie release trends

Director-wise and actor-wise performance analysis

Budget vs revenue performance evaluation

Identification of high-performing and underperforming movies

Each query is designed to answer a specific business-oriented question.

📈 Key Insights

Certain genres consistently receive higher average ratings compared to others

Popularity (votes) does not always correlate directly with high ratings

A small group of directors and actors contribute disproportionately to high-rated movies

Movie production volume varies significantly across years

Higher budget does not always guarantee better ratings

🧠 Business Use Cases

Helps production houses identify profitable genres and contributors

Supports marketing teams in targeting audience-preferred movie types

Assists streaming platforms in content acquisition strategies

Demonstrates how SQL can be used for media analytics
